# Face_Emotion_Detection
 
Face Emotion Detection helps in recognizing the kind of emotion a person is feeling. To do this, I trained and tested the model on a particular dataset known as FER2013 taken from Kaggle. I even tested the model by capturing a live image and running the model on it. It helped to check the emotions felt by a person at at a particular moment.
The code is to be run on Google Colab as the Data Augmentation, Processing, and Modelling takes up lot of RAM.
