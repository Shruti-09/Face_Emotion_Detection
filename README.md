# Face_Emotion_Detection
 
It helps in recognizing the what kind of emotion a person is feeling. To detect the emotion we have trained and tested the model on a particular dataset known as FER2013 taken from Kaggle. I have also tested the Model by capturing a live image and running the model on it. This helps to check the the emotions felt by a person at at a particular moment.
The code is to be run on Google Colab as the data Augmentation, Processing and Data Modelling takes up a lot of RAM so it can be easily done through Google Colab.
